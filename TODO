- Make ent ids compacting, the next added ent should reuse the last deleted
  ents id, else len(ents).  This will mean that the client can determine which
  ents it is missing just by knowing the len(ents).  Right now, if the client
  misses an ent on its first pass, it will have to wait until its uint32_t
  counter overflows until it makes another pass since technically ent ids could
  be anything.
- make queue better (probably just switch everything to darr)
